*Art is just decoration. Nothing more.* Well cave paintings were art and the
first steps toward the development of written language. *So I guess art gave us civilization but it's
not important like science.* Except the first scientists spent most of their time drawing and no one
without great skill at drawing could be a scientist at all until the 19th century. But no artist has
contributed anything useful... well there were the innumerable inventions of davinci and JS Bach did 
invent the 12 tone musical system which made all western music for the last 500 years possible. But it's 
not like they had anything to do with the 7 wonders of the.... oh wait.

The truth is "Artist" is a fundamental archetype meaning anyone that uses technology of some sort in a 
creative manner that results in something of exceptional aesthetic value. They play a number of vital 
roles in society, they ARE culture, and responsible for the invention of civilization in the first place.
They have been called many things such as medicine man and hacker and they pull alot of strings behind 
the scenes to keep things, well, bearable.
