Our history can be understood as one long war between those that embrace openness and sharing of ideas -
the natural mode of human action that has led to our every success - and those that horde, limit the 
flow of information and jealously guard new discoveries and inventions as if they own them. Notably 
the Greeks had an open society and the result was an explosion of progress placing them centuries 
ahead of their time. Then the library of alexandria was burned and all was lost. The jews, christians, 
and muslims then took control and 2,000 years of stagnation dominated until the renaissance when the 
open team fought back with the advent of science.

The last 500 years has been a bloody stalemate more or less and then in the 1970's and 80's a fatal blow
was struck by the good guys. The gnu public license, the birth of the opensource movement and it's 
champion linux. The invention of the internet and it's donation to the world at large also played a 
vital role. The war isn't quite over yet but it has been won. Decisively.
