Capitalism is dying and the era of giant centralized power and wealth hoarding corporations,
banks, financial institutions, social and religious organizations, and nation states is
almost, mercifully, over. The fat rich balding white dudes that have been hoarding the wealth
of the world and limiting the flow and access of information since the dawn of civilization will
not go down without a fight however so there are some ugly years to come. But the war is already won
as there is no power on heaven or earth that is a match for the collective intelligence 
of the human race. So order that case of Dom and polish your oyster tray but don't send out the
invitations just yet. There is still work to be done. 


*If you are as excited and impatient as we are join the cause and foment insurrection. Help us
hasten the pace of the revolution or if you know of a better way call us and we'll join you.*


Wakeless is a conceptional framework designed to prepare us for the impending transformation.
A set of ideologies, methodologies, architectural schemes, philosophical, social, cultural and
political perspectives based on our best educated guess of what the world will soon be like. These
ideas are constantly evolving and the more raw data, intelligent analysis, and unique perspective we
can build into the feedback loop the better these predictions will become. They are designed primarily
as a sort of template for creating or restructuring pretty much any type of organization. If
implemented well the resulting concoction should be well suited for the new paradigm. We hope. One
thing we know for certain is that an entirely new approach is needed starting with a new definition
of success.
