Leverage the power of the group to make interesting, useful, and aesthetically
pleasing things, promote the artists and engineers of the collective and
their work, aid the cause of freedom and sociable anarchism, and foment
the revolution. This is our fundamental agenda.

We value transparency and collaboration as the best means to achieve
success in all things. We despise patents, copyrights, and intellectual property.
We mock the notion of thought ownership and wonder where your supposed to
the little orange flags.

We recognize that frenetic innovation rates have triggered a revolution so
many orders of magnitude beyond any that have come before that it is essentially
beyond our ability to predict or comprehend any possible outcome. We do know,
however, that a total transformation is guaranteed. A total transformation of
culture, society, civilization, infrasctructure, the environment and the species
itself.

We have 2 major goals in this regard. 1 is to watch closely, analyze, and make
predictions then use that knowledge to create organizations built to thrive
in the new reality. 2nd is to participate in the revolution itself if even in
some small way just to be a part of this profound historic event.
