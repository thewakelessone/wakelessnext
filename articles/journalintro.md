I mean it is, but... I don't know can't think of a better title right now. I'll ask 
ChatGPT later but here's my point now.

I got my first job as a web designer in 1999. My actual title was Multimedia Director. 
Funny. I learned to program the hard way and against my will because if I wanted some 
ground breaking feature like mouseovers I had to figure it out myself. I remember building 
a cdrom for flagstaff arizona's visitor bureau. Mac OSX had just come out so I had a 
windows pc, an OSX box, and an OS9 box. I spent hours chasing fonts and layout details 
around in a circle trying to get them to look right on all 3.
  		        
Now using something like react/nextjs or any number of modern web development frameworks 
I can get a working site skeleton that looks decent running in 5 minutes and never have 
to worry about the gorie details. Is anyone complaining about frameworks stealing developers 
jobs or putting designers out of work? No. The level of quality is just way easier to 
achieve. You can still spend hours pushing pixels around if you really want to and 
individual style is still what is valued most. It's easy to get a good looking stock website 
up and running now but nobody wants to look at it and certainly no one wants to pay for it. 
A designers talent is just as valuable if not more so than it's ever been.

AI text to image generation is this same phenomenon applicable to the wider realm of all 
visual artists. Being able to generate a handful of studies to test a simple idea like 
"transformers except instead of cars they are disguised as birthday cakes" in a matter of 
minutes is just awesome. And the potential for creative discover via happy accidents, 
which has always been a powerful and fundamental technique, is now endless. No one wanted 
to see a cowboy on the moon before and they really don't now. But an artists unique style 
will never go out of style.
